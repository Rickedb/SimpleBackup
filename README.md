# Simple Backup Task

The purpose of this repository is to make backups a little more automatic and simple.
The one who will be using it must just set up his important folders on **config.json** file and the output folder.
Once it's set up, run the **.bat** in admin or the **.ps1**
> Please note that powershell execution policy must not be **restricted** to execute .ps1, if you execute .bat file, it will change restriction and then change back to his normal state
